# Machine-Learning-task-3-EDA-practice
EDA helps us understand the structure, patterns, and relationships in a dataset through visual techniques. By using plots like histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps, we can easily spot:

Distributions (e.g., how car prices are spread out)

Outliers (unusual values that might affect model accuracy)

Missing values

Trends and patterns (e.g., newer cars have higher prices)

Correlations between features (e.g., engine size vs. price)

These visual insights make complex data easier to understand and guide us in selecting the right features, cleaning the data, and choosing the right machine learning models.
